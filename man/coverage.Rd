\title{Coverage.}
\usage{
coverage(loci, allele = "_[012]$", indiv = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{loci}{a list of locus-specific sequence alignments of class \code{"matrix"} or \code{"DNAbin"}.}

\item{allele}{a regular expression defining an allele identifier (allows to distinguish individual IDs).}

\item{indiv}{an optional character vector giving complete list of individual IDs (useful to get also
individuals with zero coverage represented in the output).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of individual-specific coverages.
}
\description{
Calculates coverage, i.e., proportion of loci for which an individual was successfully sequenced.
